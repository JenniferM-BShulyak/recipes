## Research Questions

  1. Are there different trends in ratings based on a recipes category?
  2. Are certain health conscious ingredients on the rise?

### Ratings by Category


### Healthy Ingredients over Time

The number of recipes posted changed on a month-by-month basis, so the percentage of recieps with the healthy ingredient posted each month was examined. There does not appear to be a significant change in the percentage of recipes with each ingredient.

### Question 3: Certain Buzz Words Correspond to Higher Ratings (IN PROGRESS) 

Waiting to use machine learning to identify positive buzz words in descriptions.
